In front of you on the screen, there will be 2 decks of cards. When we begin the game, I want you to select one deck at a time by clicking on a card from any deck you choose. Each time you select a card, the computer will tell you that you won some money... you will find out how much as we go along. You are absolutely free to switch from one deck to the other at any time, and as often as you wish. The goal of the game is to win as much money as possible. You won't know when the game will end. Simply keep on playing until the computer stops. The only hint I can give you, and the most important thing to note is this: the computer does not change the order of the cards once the game begins. Your winnings are NOT chosen at random, nor are your winnings based on the last card you picked. If you have any questions, please ask the researcher now. Otherwise, click the mouse to begin.
